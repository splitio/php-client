# Split SDK for PHP

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/php-client.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/php-client)

This SDK is designed to work with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with PHP 5.6 and above.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK.
Keep in mind that since PHP does not have the ability to share memory between processes the use of the [split-synchronizer](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019686092-Split-Synchronizer-Proxy) is mandatory for this SDK.

```php
<?php

$sdkConfig = ['cache' => ['adapter' => 'predis']];
$splitFactory = \SplitIO\Sdk::factory('SDK_API_KEY', $sdkConfig);

$splitClient = $splitFactory->client();
$treatment = $splitClient->getTreatment('CUSTOMER_ID','SPLIT_NAME');
if ($treatment === 'on') {
    // Feature is enabled for this user!
} elseif ($treatment === 'off') {
    // Feature is disabled for this user!
} else {
    // Unable to perform evaluation.
}
```
